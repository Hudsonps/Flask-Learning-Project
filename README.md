# Flask-Learning-Project
This repository contains files needed for running an app created with the Flask library in Python.
I am following the tutorial provided by Miguel Grinberg in his blog, which can be accessed in the link below:
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

The project is currently structured as follows:
microblog/
  app/
      /templates
      __init.py__
      routes.py
  config.py
  microblog.py
  
<b>microblog.py</b> is the main application.
<b>microblog.py</b> sets some configurations related to Flask and its extensions

<b>app/templates</b> contains HTML templates rendered by the application
<b>app/__init__.py</b> initializes the application

<b>app/routes.py</b> contains the various functions of our application, and the respective URL's that call these functions
